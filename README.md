When a file is added to 'input files', an event fires, the input file content is sent to the algorithm, and the solution is appended.

Optional monitor (by running `node index.js` from the `node` folder). \
The main app is run as usual in java (ide / jar). 

*note: maybe i overcomplicated (a bit..) because i like to try stuff.

Demo shows what happens when files are added to the watched folder.
